# Shift Scheduler Tool Project Specification

## Overview

This document defines the specifications for the development of a Shift Scheduling Tool intended for small business operations. The tool aims to manage employees' shift preferences and generate efficient shift schedules accordingly.

## System Requirements

- **Data Input**: Employees submit their shift preferences using a Google Form.
- **Data Output**: The scheduler exports the collected shift preferences from the spreadsheet as a CSV file.
- **Processing**: A Python script is executed locally to generate the shift schedule.
- **UI**: A GUI provided by Python's `tkinter` library simplifies script execution.
- **Result Presentation**: The generated shift schedule is exported as a CSV file, which is then imported into a spreadsheet for viewing.

## User Interface

- **Form Input Screen**: A Google Form for employees to submit their shift preferences.
- **GUI**: A simple interface with buttons for the scheduler to upload the CSV file and generate the shift schedule.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Data Import**:
   - Automatic synchronization of inputs from Google Form to the spreadsheet.
   - Scheduler downloads the preferences data as a CSV from the spreadsheet.

2. **Shift Schedule Creation**:
   - Python script reads the CSV file.
   - Automatically generates a shift schedule based on the preferences.

3. **Results Output and Sharing**:
   - Generated shift schedule is exported as a CSV file.
   - Imported CSV in a spreadsheet for display.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Google Forms
  - Google Sheets
- **Backend**:
  - Python
  - `tkinter` library (for GUI)
- **Data Processing**:
  - `pandas` library (for CSV reading and writing)

## Development and Deployment

- **Development Environment**: Python development environment on local machines.
- **Version Control**: Use of GitHub for source code versioning.
- **Deployment**: Distribution to users through executable batch files or shell scripts.

## Security

- **Data Protection**: Implement a process to ensure the safe handling and storage of CSV data.
- **Access Management**: Proper management of access permissions to the spreadsheet.

## Support and Maintenance

- **Documentation**: Provide a user guide and troubleshooting documentation.
- **Error Handling**: Offer detailed error messages within the script to aid user understanding of issues.
- **Updates**: An automatic notification system for when new script versions become available.
